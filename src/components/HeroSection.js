      <p>My name is <strong>Chris Cooley</strong>.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p> I'm currently doing a bootcamp through the University of Utah to become a full stack web developer. Throughout my studies, I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongDB, React.js and many other languages. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology where I originally planned on becoming a counselor, but later chose to pursue a career with web development. I live in Saint George, UT, where I met my wife, Star. We just bought a house this past year. In my free time, I love playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, running, and bowling. I also love to just relax and watch a good movie. </p>
